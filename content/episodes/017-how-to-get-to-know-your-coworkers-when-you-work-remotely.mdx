description: "One of the challenges with working from home is building trust and relationship between you and your coworkers. It's easy to occupy the same digital space and get work done without knowing anything about your team. Better relationships leads to better work, and so the challenge is worth it. As a follow-up to the previous episode on the downsides of working alone, we discuss some practical ways to get to know your coworkers when working remotely."

- **0:00** - **5:28** - We nerd out about some coffee stuff. It's all good fun.
- **5:28** - Relationships with coworkers are inherently different when you work with a remote team instead of working together in the same physical space. There are micro-interactions and non-verbal communications that just don't exist in the same way when you don't work alongside people.
- **8:19** - That doesn't mean you can't have relationships or friendships with your coworkers. When you work remotely there are no opportunities for serendipitous interactions, you have to make the effort.
- **9:34** - One of the ways you can easily connect with coworkers is to start up an "open work" group call and just invite other people to join in and "work together".
- **10:45** - It's easy to alienate or be alienated as an employee if you and your coworkers don't make the effort to reach out to one another.
- **15:01** - Having calls with teammates that only ever pertain to work will not help build good relationships with your team.
- **16:20** - Even though you can't manufacture those micro-interactions, you can still improve relationships with your team through other methods.
- **20:27** - One of the ways we learn about our teammates at ConvertKit is to do a red/yellow/green check to see how everyone's doing, and we have some check-in meetings with highs and lows and so on. These are a bit more informal and help us to get to know each other on an ongoing basis.
- **21:46** - The foundation of this whole conversation is that if you want a strong team, you need there to be trust. Remote workers sometimes have to work hard to build trust with each other.
- **24:01** - If you own a business or run any sort of team, make check-in calls part of your teams' culture. You can't know how your people are doing if you don't check in.
- **25:08** - In a very serious reality check, your check-ins with your team may reveal truths about their physical or mental health that may need attention.
- **36:34** - A few ways you can start getting to know your coworkers:
    - Host a "coffee call" or an "office party" with games and non-work discussion
    - Set up a 1-on-1 call with a coworker to get to know each other
    - Have a group co-working session where everyone is muted but working together
- **41:21** - If you're introverted or uncomfortable setting up these sorts of calls, start small! Try speaking up a little during team calls. Bring up your needs to your manager and see if they have ideas. Add your voice to Slack chats where you wouldn't normally.

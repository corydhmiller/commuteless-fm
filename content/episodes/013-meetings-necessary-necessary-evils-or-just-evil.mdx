description: "In the previous episode we talked about video calls specifically and our own fatigue with them. In this episode weâ€™re going to put our focus directly on meetings. When you work remote, they can be either helpful...or very much not. Are they actually necessary, or are there other ways to communicate that improve how we work?"

- **1:58** - There's a lot to be said about meetings, especially when you work from home when it might feel like there's more meetings than their should be.
- **4:54** - We talk about how many meetings we have during our weeks and what they look like.
- **5:23** - Sometimes working corporate means you have meetings to plan for meetings to talk about the meeting you're going to have later.
- **14:03** - There are different types of meetings that may come up during a week, but for the most part they can be boiled down to two: additive or subtractive.
- **17:37** - The root of the difference comes from the specific nature and desired outcome of the meeting.
- **20:21** - The most important step before having a meeting is determining whether the meeting even needs to happen.
- **21:17** - Kyle tells a story about some meetings he was required to be at during his corporate job experience: "You were on the project checklist so I invited you to the meeting."
- **24:16** - Thinking about why you're including the people you're including, and whenever possible, give them an option to show up or not and provide a way for them to catch up later.
- **27:10** - If the context of the meeting can be handled in an asynchronous way in a post or email or other sort of method that doesn't require syncing of calendars or isn't urgent, consider not having a meeting and hosting the conversation in a different medium.
- **29:22** - There are almost always alternatives to meetings that may be more respectful of the other persons' time.
- **32:22** - Establishing processes and documenting how they work will be better in the long term for the productivity of your team.
- **36:11** - Any time we set up a meeting, there's a possibility that we're breaking up the work "flow" of our teammates. Take into account the cost of setting up a meeting.
- **42:38** - We talk about a handy formula for evaluating the cost of a meeting.
- **44:34** - What would it look like in your team, company, or organization if you defaulted to no meetings? What would need to change in order to accomplish your goals?
- **47:18** - It's not always necessary to eliminate meetings completely. Regular, weekly team meetings can help to prevent isolation and encourage more unity within a team.

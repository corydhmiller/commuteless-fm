- **0:06** - We introduce Austin Saylor, a motion designer who has been working from home full time for just over four years.
- **3:43** - Austin explains a bit about his freelance work, courses, and membership program teaching people how to do motion design.
- **5:53** - How Austin's work setup has changed over time since moving into their current house.
- **9:35** - We all have different reasons for enjoying working from home, and Austin shares his favorites.
- **13:25** - Having complete freedom and autonomy can be wonderful on one hand, but requires a lot of discipline to make sure the work gets done.
- **17:00** - When you work for yourself, it's oftentimes just you developing out the framework for productivity. There's a lot of benefit to having others to hold you accountable to your work.
- **21:16** - Working from home with a spouse or partner can be both fun and challenging at the same time. We talk about the dynamics of multiple people working in the same home and how Austin and his wife Rachel handle their co-working and relationship.
- **24:45** - One of the most helpful things for them was reading [Deep Work by Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) together.
- **27:26** - Using a "shared language" to communicate work needs will help to prevent miscommunication and will easily help you immediately know what the other person means.
- **28:52** - Without good structure or a shared language to discipline yourself, it can be easy to get distracted. Set aside time to connect as a couple, but you also have to protect your time as well.
- **30:39** - Austin shares some thoughts and what he's working on with handling conflict with his wife during work times.
- **36:43** - When you live with more than one other person who works from home, the dynamic changes and you have to find a good equilibrium for everyone to get work done.
- **38:51** - Austin and Rachel use a to-do app to synchronize their collective lists of things to keep in mind to get from the store. The things that help you work better help you live better, and vice versa.
- **40:22** - Austin shares his thoughts on "work/life balance" and prefers to think of it as bigger picture balance.
- **42:20** - Consider picking out a few books to read together with your partner or spouse to continue to build a common language around your work time. Austin also recommends [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) and [The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz](https://www.miguelruiz.com/the-four-agreements).
- **42:59** - Austin discusses *The Four Agreements* and how it's had an impact on his work. "The Four Agreements**" are
   ** - Be impeccable with **your word
   ** - Don't take **anything personally
   ** - Don't **make assumptions
   ** - Always do your best
- **47:43** - Asking for clarification might make you feel like you don't know what you're talking about, but generally this gives a better floor for improved communication between you and your housemates or co-workers.

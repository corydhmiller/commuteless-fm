- **1:50** - Why communication is important to us.
- **4:16** - There are two "categories" of people you have to learn to communicate with when you work from home: the people in your life and the people on the other side of the screen.
- **7:20** - Define and understand your own needs.
    - It's not enough to know your schedule, you have to understand how you work best.
    - Do you need it to be quiet and have zero interruptions? Do you need sunlight? Do you need to have your phone off? Do you need to start work at a certain time and end at a certain time? Do you have set/unchanging meetings and calls?
- **11:46** - Over communicate constantly with those who live with you.
    - People don't really hear you when you tell them what you're doing. They don't care about your schedule at all times of the day. You have to repeat yourself and really make things known.
- **13:20** - Don't expect others to remember everything you've told them, especially about your schedule. Remind them and talk about it, because people forget.
- **15:37** - Schedule a specific time to talk about your needs with work and your schedule.
    - Have an initial conversation dedicated to scheduling.
    - Talk about your needs regularly.
    - Your schedule impacts everyone around you, and you need to honor that.
- **22:23** - Donâ€™t assume others know your needs.
    - One of the worst things you can do is be mad at someone for not "respecting your schedule." It isn't their job to remember, it's your job to remind them.
    - There are plenty of things you can do to be proactive about protecting your time and focus, like muting notifications (do not disturb mode), turning off notifications for email, social media, etc.
- **33:12** - Help people understand your needs are about *you*, not them.
    - Give permission to the people in your life to ask questions about what you need.
- **42:35** - Bonus tip: Use "Do Not Disturb While Driving" to automatically reply to people during your work hours.

But when you work from home there is a dynamic shift. Where you are and specifically when you are there are less important in many cases and the focus falls more on your output. Working from home affords us some flexibility, so what does it look like to stay healthy and on track when you can set up some rules for yourself?"

In an office setting there is more control over where you are and when you are there. Even other small factors are delegated, that just comes with the territory. But when you work from home there is a dynamic shift. Where you are and specifically when you are there are less important in many cases and the focus falls more on your output. Working from home affords us some flexibility, so what does it look like to stay healthy and on track when you can set up some rules for yourself?

**Month-to-month**

- The start of the month is a reset for many people, but it may be a new beginning for you. Find out how you feel during that time and work to that strength (when you schedule things, deadlines you set, etc).
- Always look at the length of the month you're approaching in business days rather than calendar days. Determine how you feel about the layout of the month (start and end dates, etc), then use that info to get a feel for how your month might flow.

**Week-to-week**

- Just like with months, weeks a flow to them as well. Many see Monday as a grueling day while others see it as a fresh start. Use whichever you are to your advantage.
- Recommended: Intentionally make certain days slower than others. For me (Kyle), I make my Mondays and Fridays slower, so I ramp up output in the middle. But you could also do the opposite and have some rest mid-week.
- Check the weather for your week. Weather does affect our mood in some interesting ways and at least knowing what's coming can help you push through.

**Day-to-day**

- Are you a morning person or a night person? Depending on when you get your best work done, try to arrange your day to match. So, for example, if you are more social in the evenings, schedule calls toward the end of your work day.
- Give yourself a reward goal. When you're done with the day, what happens? For me (Kyle) this is often play some video games, watch some YouTube, something mindless that will feel like good rest.

description: "Working from home is a mix of structure and chaos, routine and unknown. Life has changed for a lot of people this year, and our work environments seem to keep shifting as well. Every few episodes we pretend like we're not recording and just have a conversation like we're catching up at a coffee shop, and on today's show we talk about some of the ways we keep focused even when life is constantly changing around us."

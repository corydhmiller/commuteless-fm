description: "Working in an office or directly around other people provides you with a context of communication, both verbal and non-verbal. There are plenty of opportunities to engage with co-workers and get or receive information. Working from home means you have to be much more intentional about information, relationships, and communication with those you work with. In this episode we talk about how to improve your online communication with your workmates and why it's important to foster as much clarity and understanding as possible."

- **2:03** - Don't assume everyone knows the same information.
    - Never assume someone knows something unless you're 1,000% positive they do.
    - Be thorough with explanations. For example: "Will you share your screen tomorrow and show that doc we were working on?" You might know that really means: "During tomorrow's meeting with Kevin will you share your screen and show him the doc with ideas for the podcast that we've been working on?"
    - It takes longer for information to pass back and forth online than it does in person. You can save a lot of time by clarifying what you're before you're asked to clarify.
    - Most people probably don't know what you're working on, especially if you're on a larger team.
- **10:16** - Take a lot of notes. More notes than you might think!
    - When you have notes you spend less time asking questions that might take a while to get answers, because you can simply check the notes.
        - Examples: Google Docs, Ulysses, Microsft Word, Notion
    - You can also pull out your phone and record meetings (with permission of course).
- **15:31** - You have to be willing to say no.
    - You can't afford distractions. Turn off your external notifications so you can focus on what's important.
    - Sometimes an impromptu meeting just won't work, and that's OK.
    - Filling *all* of your time with work is not OK. Just because you work from home doesn't mean you have to work a 9-9 job.
    - You don't have to give out personal communication details.
- **28:29** - Have a space for both long-form and real-time communication.
    - Examples: [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), [Asana](https://asana.com/), [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Guru](https://www.getguru.com/)
- **32:41** - Remember to stay organized.
    - While working from home has a lot of benefits, one of the downsides is that you're in charge of keeping track of every single bit of information that comes your way. Nobody is passing by you and reminding you of things. You have to keep everything in a to-do list.

- **Bonus:** You've got to get good sleep! Being tired is taxing on your mental capacity and ability to juggle all of your tasks.

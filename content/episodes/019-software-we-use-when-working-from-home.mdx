description: "It's almost inevitable that if you work from home you're going to be on a computer of some sort. The software you use on a daily basis becomes the means by which you get your work done, and so we think you should be using the best software you can. In this episode we talk about some of our favorite apps and services and how we use them."

- **2:07** - You shouldn't be reusing any passwords, and it can be difficult to remember all of them. Use a password manager like [1Password](https://1password.com/), [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/), or [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/), and tighten up your account security.
- **9:16** - [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/) allows you to set up snippets of text from quick abbreviations. Type in your shortcut and it expands out into whatever you want it to. An incredible time-saver that saves you from redundant typing.
- **17:07** - [Backblaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01nqwa) is a cloud storage backup service that works behind the scenes on your computer to continuously and securely store your data. You should always have multiple backups for your data and Backblaze is one of the top services out there for this.

- **22:40** - [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) is a task management software for macOS, iOS, and iPadOS, with a simple yet powerful interface for handling your upcoming to-dos for the day and beyond. We also recommend picking up Shawn Blanc's course [All The Things](https://thesweetsetup.com/things/), a calm course on productivity and task management.
- **27:07** - [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is a productivity app with customizable workflows, snippets, expanded file search, clipboard history, and more. It's an incredibly powerful and versatile little app for macOS, even if just for clipboard history (seriously, if you're not using clipboard history, you *need* to get that up and running some way somehow).
- **34:12** - If you've ever wanted to record your screen and create seamless and custom recordings for tutorials, walkthroughs, or troubleshooting, [ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) is a fantastic screen recording app for macOS that gives you both recording and editing capabilities straight in the software.
- **39:31** - Bonus software we use: [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)

description: "The tendency to become distracted can be challenging to overcome, especially when you work in an environment by yourself or when there's copious amounts of freedom given. The discipline required to really get things done at home has to come from within. You have to take control of your attention and cut out the things that are taking your focus away from where it needs to be. In this episode, we're going to talk about one of the top distractions that is begging for your attention every minute of every day and how to overcome it."

- **1:06** - The top things we (Kyle and Cory) are most likely to get distracted by on any given work day.
- **8:35** - The one thing you can do to reduce (or completely remove) distractions from work: turn off notifications.
- **9:48** - Everyone and everything wants your attention, from websites to apps to friends and family. In most cases, notifications is how they get your attention first.
- **11:00** - Check your apps' notification settings and see if they have any types of specific options.
- **12:00** - Chatting through our own notification settings.
- **22:27** - Every notification is someone walking up behind you, tapping you on the shoulder, and saying, "Excuse me I have something to tell you," and waiting until you respond.
- **23:38** - A notification is someone else demanding for your attention. When you allow notifications to interrupt you, you are giving them power over your productivity.
- **27:10** - Our tools demanding our attention has slowly crept up on us over the years. Be mindful of what is taking up your attention.
- **29:38** - Cory gets mad about marketing and recipe websites.
- **30:31** - Not all notifications are bad. Sometimes they can be really helpful. The point is to be intentional about what is being displayed to you and when.
- **33:45** - A fun exercise is to go through all of your notifications on your devices and turn them all off. Then, one by one, enable the ones you *need*.
- **34:18** - In most cases you don't have to respond to anything immediately, especially email. Email isn't designed to be instant messaging. Not everything has to be urgent.
